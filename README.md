In order to install/use sass:

* [Install ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

* [Install bundler.](http://bundler.io/#getting-started) (Used to ensure we run the same version of sass.)

* To install sass using bundler, run `bundle install` in the directory where the Gemfile is.

* Run the `parse-sass.sh` script.

* The script will compile sass and run a sass watch. [For more info check the sass docs.](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass)
